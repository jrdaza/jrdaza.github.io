                                Decided to make website logging things here to document the proccess 
                                since I do not know how to make a website hopefully portfolio based.
                                I have finals in a little under 2 weeks so I will be putting this off until winter break.

                                Researched for week about basic html and css by reading documentation and watching videos
                                I was able to create a local basic website that isn't currently hosted at the time of 
                                writing this post. I plan to use GitHub Pages to make hosting this really simple.
                            </p>
                            <p> I actually tried using a gray color scheme at first but thought it looked really off. <br>
